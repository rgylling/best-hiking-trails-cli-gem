# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
*A list of trails is presented to the user and the CLI class asks for a number from the user and presents information based off the number of trail the user types in. The user is allowed to type 1-10 for information based on the corresponding trail. Invalid input is rejected, and the user is prompted to enter 'list' to re list the trails or 'exit' to exit the program.*
- [x] Pull data from an external source
*When the program is ran the Trails class is initialized, and scrapes trail names and information from [theoutbound.com](https://www.theoutbound.com/theoutbound/the-best-25-hikes-in-america) and creates objects for each trail with a name and information for each trail.*
- [x] Implement both list and detail views
*Once the application is started, a list of trails is presented to the user. The user then enters the number of a particular trail they want more information about.*
